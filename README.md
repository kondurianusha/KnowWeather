# KnowWeather
A very minimalistic weather app whose main purpose of existence is to show how to use Firebase, Retrofit, OkHttp, RxJava and Data Binding in a single project. This app allows a user to add cities in the app and is shown the basic weather information. The cities added by user are saved in Firebase based on user's device id.
